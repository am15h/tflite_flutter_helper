/// Quantizes a [TensorBuffer] with given [zeroPoint] and [scale].
///
///
/// Note: [QuantizeOp] does not cast output to UINT8, but only performs the quantization
/// math on top of input. The data type of output tensor is always [FLOAT32] except that the Op
/// is effectively an identity Op (in this case, the output tensor is the same instance as the
/// input). To connect with quantized model, a [CastOp] is probably needed.
///
///
/// If both [zeroPoint] and [scale] are 0, the [QuantizeOp] will be bypassed,
/// which is equivalent to setting [zeroPoint] to 0 and [scale] to 1. This can be useful
/// when passing in the quantization parameters that are extracted directly from the TFLite model
/// flatbuffer. If the tensor is not quantized, both [zeroPoint] and [scale] will be read
/// as 0.
